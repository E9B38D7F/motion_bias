HOW TO RUN:

simulator.py generates the relevant datasets
10000 iterations of simulator.py takes about six hours
If you want to save time, you can download outputs I generated from:

Contents:
	likelihood_sim_splits: position bias is approx uniform over (-1.2, 1.2)
	posterior_sim_splits: position bias is distributed approx by prior
	data_flat_bias: the former, processed with estimates and dispersion
	data_prior_bias: the latter, processed with estimates and dispersion
